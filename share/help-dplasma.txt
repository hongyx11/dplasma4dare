[cu*_alloc_failed]
There was not enough memory available on a CUDA device
while trying to allocate a %s handle to manage tasks on
this device, or another CUDA device on the node. The
PaRSEC runtime system may be configured to reserve too
much memory on CUDA devices. Try reducing the amount of
reserved memory by setting the PaRSEC MCA parameter
'device_cuda_memory_use' to a lower value.
